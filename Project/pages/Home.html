	Bloodbeard, The forgotten clan known for their fearsome abilities in battle and impenetrable castle; lived for decades in the mountain of Gaurager with the leadership of King Boendal and Queen Nalvaris and kept guarding it from invaders such as elves, orcs, trolls and many more. 
	Their name "Bloodbeard" was from their history of battles because when they fight their beard looks like the blood from their enemies they killed and it also strikes fear in their enemies in battle. In battle the Bloodbeards always used their strongest army the Balyndis, 
	composed of the finest dwarves in Gaurager. The Bloodbeard clan isn't only about battles, they also mine crystal selling it to their allied races for fortune & forging weapons and they also believed the spirit of animals give them strength to fight in battle. One day the 
	bloodbeard was slaughtered and world of astria heard the news believing that their clan is now forever extinct. The story of the bloodbeards is not ending, the son of king Boendal survived and his story is told here from his childhood to how he joined TEAM CHECKWEATHER.
